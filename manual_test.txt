Suggested input for manual testing of the initial rule set:

Loan type: '7-1 ARM', Standard
State: Florida, Texas
Credit Score: 710, 730, 721
Initial Interest rate: 5.0

Expected results:
When loan type is '7-1 ARM', state is Texas and credit score is 710, 721, 730
The expected results are:
Product NOT disqualified for all combinations.
Final interest rate:
710 -> 6.0
721 -> 5.2
730 -> 5.2

Change the above data so that the loan type is Standard (all other values the same) leads to the following results:
710 -> 5.5
721 -> 4.7
730 -> 4.7
Again the product is NOT disqualified for any of these combinations.

When the State is changed to Florida, the customer will be disqualified from the product but there are no other changes to the results.
